# City in the Sky

## A Goblin Hunt
The party makes their way toward the Aldani Basin, where the Heart of Ubtao is said to be. During Tycerian's watch, however, he is attacked and kidnapped by a group of goblins, who stealthily knock him unconscious and drag him to their goblin town called Yellyark. The party wakes up to find a camp without Tycerian, as well as blood splatters and arrows. Following the trail of goblin footsteps, they first come upon a small clearing, which seems to be empty but for a tall statue-like object sitting beneath the trees. The trail continues past this into a larger clearing - a goblin encampment, with small huts and about fifty goblins. 

## Yellyark Camp

After taking a closer look, the entire town appears to be sitting on a circular mat, made of hides, attached to ropes around the outside, converging to an area above the mat, and tied to a tree that is bent beyond its natural shape. The tree itself has this shape due to a strong rope holding it down, each end tied around large rocks embedded in the ground. The entire encampment is essentially the load of a catapult. 

Tycerian becomes conscious, inside a bamboo cage. He can undo the ropes that hold his cage together, grab his weapons and pack, before being spotted by guards. Unleashing his fire breath, and using his martial skill, the dragonborn can kill the guards, but not before alerting the entire village of his presence. Tycerian, realizing he can't kill them all, squeezes his way below the tent's canvass, and runs for his life. 

Seeing the flames and the dragonborn, the rest of the party leap to action and attack. Shots are fired at the goblins, and Flint cuts lose the rope holding the tree down, sending the entire goblin camp, and the goblins, into the jungle. The woman and children, evacuated from the contraption, survive. 

Sometime after they find what remains of the village. All the goblins died, and amongst their loot is a necklace with the word VORN written into, which Flint receives.
