## Camp Vengeance
Once in Camp Vengeance the party meets with its leader Commander Ilral, a human male, on the older side but armored and strong. He leads the Bronze Division, a section of the Order of the Forge tasked with defending its miners from threats and clearing out tunnels. There is a mine they'll be visiting soon, under the mountain Unomo. Commander Ilral asks if they'll clear it out, and they accept the task. Shortly after, they come upon Hector, who works as a healer for the Order. He is presented the box by Flint and brings news of his dying brother. In return, Flint is rewarded a Ring of Protection for giving him the news and his brother's last gift. The party then sets off to complete their task. They are given limited information: to expect fire newts. 

## Burning Bridges
On their way there, they encounter a bridge, and what seems to be a trap set up by the fire newts, who are waiting for them to approach. After killing all but one, the party takes the remaining one prisoner, prying information from him about the mines. The fire newt says little other than to expect ten or so, and an additional reinforcement arriving within days to deal with a threat within the mines. The group moves toward the mine, which has a narrow entrance. A trap is spotted near the entrance, which the party carefully avoids. However, the fire newt intentionally sets off the trap. Those in front of him manage to duck in time, with the fire newt taking the blow from a swinging log, knocking him to the ground. For betraying their trust, Tycerian cuts the fire newtâ€™s head off, as footsteps are heard from within the mine. The party retreats from the cave entrance as ten or so fire newts and a strange flying creature runs at them. Dodging spells, the party managed to outrun them to the bridge they had encountered before, now burned. Grimwald and Aramil fasten a rope to two trees to cross the ravine below and make their way up it to safety before cutting the rope, effectively ending the chase.
