## Trouble at the Docks
The party awakens to the calls for help. Quickly, they arm themselves and make their way to the docks to find only three guards, with one of them leaving to get more help. In the distance, there is a ship approaching, strangely moving backwards, and with the top of its mast ablaze. There is a sense that something has gone wrong with the escort, and the few guards that are available are preparing for the worst. An armored man steps up from behind the wheel of the ship, overlooking the party and guards on the dock. He stairs plainly. Aramil telepathically messages the man and hears what his final words would be: "Run" A shadow races across the boat, forms behind the armored man and a shadow blade materializes, cutting through his armor and piercing through his chest. He slumps on the ship rail before hitting ground, as the shadow continuously attacks him. The guards and party launch an attack, as skeletons and zombies appear on the ship and counter. Unable to get there in time, the armored man, later identified as the Baron's son, Cailen Stefford, is killed. The guards and party manage to kill all the undead on the ship. 

## A Failed Attempt
The dead body of Cailen Stefford is carried off the ship, strangely without a hand. He is rushed to the Wavecrest Temple, where an attempt is made to resurrect the only heir to the Wavecrest Barony. The Baron himself, William Stefford, requests the aid of all those with healing powers to join in the attempt. Attempt after attempt are made, all of which fail. The attempts are called off by the Baron, and he asks for a meeting between those who witnessed the attack and himself. 

## The Adventure Begins
The party explains what happened at the docks. William tells the party of a curse that may have something to do with the failed resurrection attempts, one that originated on Chult. He sends the party to investigate, and they accept.
