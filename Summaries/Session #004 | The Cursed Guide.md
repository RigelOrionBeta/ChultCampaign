# The Cursed Guide

*by Volothamp Geddarm*

*19th of September, the Year 2054*

## Port Nyanzaru
The journey has brought them to jungle island of Chult, specifically its only now-only inhabited large settlement, Port Nyanzaru. They are greeted by its harbormaster, Jun'tal, a male half-dragon. The party, having decided to make Wayward Bard their own ship, strike a deal to keep it without having to pay parking dues - by loaning it to the port in exchange for a small payment. The party says goodbye to the crew of Reverend's Regret and explore the port. The land is certainly foreign - dinosaurs roam the street, some carrying goods, some carrying guards. 

## Seeking Friends
On the advice of William Stefford, they find Wakanga O'tamu, an old college friend of the Baron and one of the powerful Merchant Princes of the port. Wakanga gives them some tips about the island, the curse, and the whereabouts of a guide that he has close ties with named Saerumir. Wakanga needs to leave however, to attend an execution.The party tails along after Aramil realizes the description of the one being executed matches one of his people. 

## Executioner's Run
They make their way to the Executioner's Run, a long, rectangle shaped ditch containing obstacles and dinosaurs. In it is an elf Aramil recognizes the tattoo of - the tattoo of the Yaewyr tribe, of which Aramil is a member. As a distraction, Grimwald causes the ground to tremble, and Aramil sets a fire, causing a panic among the crowds. The Princes overseeing the execution retreat from their perches. The chaos allows the elf to escape unnoticed. 

## Finding A Guide
They meet back up briefly to plan a meeting the next day after things settle down, before finding a tavern to lay low. It is at the Siren's Song Tavern they meet Saerumir, a male elf, who works as a guide. Saerumir is afflicted by the curse, which seems to also have the effect of slowly killing those who had been resurrected, as he had during one of his journeys. The party hires him and prepare for the journey to start tomorrow.
