# The Dead of Night

## Arrival
Tycerian Naxx, Grimwald Blackstaff, Flint Ironforge and Aramil Moonwhisper all arrive at Wavecrest, sharing a drink at the Misty Inn. Waiting for a boat to arrive in the next couple days, which is out on an escort missing run by the son of the Baron of Wavecrest, they spend the day on a quest: to kill some goblins who have been attacking a lumber camp the last few days. Wavecrest is short on guards and needs help, so they provide it. After speaking with the head of the guard of Wavecrest, the party get information on the whereabouts of the goblin camp and head out. 

After traversing the woods for a half hour, they come upon the goblin menace, and the party makes quick work of them. After delivering the proof, the adventurers calls it a day, retreating to the Misty Inn for a rest. Before sleeping, the party listens in on the rumors going around: one rumor being of a curse on the island of Chult to the west of Wavecrest. Tycerian also meets Volothamp "Volo" Geddarm, an author who tasks him with finding and describing monsters he may encounter in his adventures for a future book he's writing. 

In the dead of night, a man on horseback rides past the inn with a torch, yelling for help at the docks.
