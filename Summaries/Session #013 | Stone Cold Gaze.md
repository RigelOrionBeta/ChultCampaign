# Stone Cold Gaze

## Wandering
Party is looking for their way as they come across a rope hanging from the sky, the end wrapping a bag. Aramil shoots an arrow and breaks the rope, however the bag doesn't fall, suspended in the air fifteen above them. After a couple attempts, they manage to bring the bag down with its contents - potions and an Immovable Rod.

## Mausoleum at Mezro

Figure appears with scabbard decorated with images of flames, and was expecting an adventuring party. The figure claimed to be the ruler of Mezro. He asked the party to look for a book within the mausoleum, in the tomb of a long dead Mezroan ruler. He introduced himself as Isalawa, explaining the book has secrets about the defenses of Mezro written by Ubtao himself. The Samaranchian Empire is expected to attack and they are made up of Yuan-ti, Orcs, Goblins, and Lizard folk. Isalawa doesn’t make note of Tycerian or Flint.

Isalawa is expecting the people from Omu and Mbala to come to assist in this attack. He also claims the year to be 950. The mauloeum consists of multiple floors, which are added as the mausoleum is filled. The long dead noble Malaka, one of the founders of Mezro, is the oldest of the Mezroan nobles burried here, and his tomb contains the tome he seeks. Isalawa mentioned that there are most likely dangers in the mausoleum, since it has not been opened and swept in some time. The party decides to help and enters through the double wooden doors.

## Tycerian the Stone

They enter a room filled with statues, seemingly dedicated to members of the Mezroan nobility. Flint finds a mirror shield on the wall. Flint puts it back since it is a part of the tomb. At the bottom of the mausoleum the party walks into a dead end. They try the doors but they do not budge. Tycerian smacks the door with his warhammer as the party walks back startled. Tycerian smacked a hole into the door and peered through the hole and saw two circles moving toward the door. The party looks at the rest of the room while Tycerian continues pounding on the door. Aramil finds a book on one of the sarcophagi and pulls the book from it. As that happens Tycerian sees the two eyes appear again through the now-opening door, and Flint hears clicking as a wall begins falling down at the top of the staircase, which would close off the room and trap them.

An 8 foot long blue skinned creature appears. It has long teeth that you want to investigate. Flint knows these creatures to be basalisks. As Aramil moves, the statue behind him awaken, and take a swing at him. The party finds themself being attacked by two basilisks and two living statues as they try to run from this engagement. As Aramil and Tycerian investigate the basilisks they feel their strength weakening and turning stiff. Tycerian finds himself under a flurry of attacks by the statues and basilisk as he attempts to retreat with the others. The basilisks get in front of him, and he gets turned to stone by the basilisk. 

## Pulling Out The Rod

Aramil takes out the rod from his pants and blocks the door and then runs into the fray and casts Fists of the Four thunders. Aramil dashes in smashing the ground and all the creatures. Flint reluctantly rushes in to assist attempting to finish off one of the basilisks. However, he misses and now faces the dangers of the basilisk. The armor suits come after Aramil and slashes him with a flurry of blows. Flint faces both basilisk as they attempt to freeze them and fail. As one of them smash through Flints armor putting their posing into him. Grimwald comes back from behind the wall and shatters the armor destroying both saving Aramil. Aramil fires his short bow killing one of the basilisks. Closing his eyes Flint smashes the basilisk directly in front of him. As Flint hides behind his shield the basilisk flanks him and bites into Flints leg. Grimwald fires off a guiding bolt smashing into the basilisk. As Aramil comes up to finish the basilisk off with his short bow. Grimwald comes out from hiding as the basilisk are all finished off. The party investigates the wreckage looking for potentially anything they may have missed.

The party puts Tycerian into the bag of holding and keeps him in the petrified state. As Grimwald keeps Tycerian safe on the way-out Flint grabs the mirror shield on the way out of the tomb. The party leaves the mausoleum and sees Isalawa. As Isalawa notices one of the party members is missing and offers to bring the member back and restore his status. The party pulls Tycerian out of the bag and Isalawa touches Tycerian bringing him back from being stone. Tycerian, startled since he last saw the basilisk, he is now safe.

## Power Struggle

Aramil asks about people who may have been banished. Isalawa mentions that people do leave but nothing is certain. Isalawa continues, saying Ubtao is the ruler of Chult, and Mezro is the capital, and some may claim that Omu is the real leader, however it is more like Chult is a collection of independent cities, all claiming some right to importance on Chult. Omu claims that Ubtao is in their favor, however, Isalawa counters that Mezro was built by Ubtao and feels that Omu is falling from grace since they are more focused on the mining of gold and collection of treasures, which is contrary to Ubtao's way. 

Isalawa also claims that he is a barae. The barae is a chosen from Ubtao and is granted magical abilities of restoration, eternal life, teleportation, among other abilities. Barae are held in high regard in Chult. Isalawa is dedicated to Ubtao and sacrificed his life many times in the name of Ubtao. Ubtao speaks to Isalawa in dreams and in person. Aramil hands over the book to Isalawa. Aramil asks if this book can send Mezro into another plain of existence. Mbala is an ally of Mezro and both assist each other in times of need. Isalawa feels that Mmbala is better defended then Mezro, due to it being on a mesa. He also explains the attack on Mezro from the Samarachians is led by Dendar the Night Serpent himself, who the party understands, at least in their time, to be defeated by Ubtao and imprisoned beneath Chult.

Isalawa takes notes and writes down all the names of the party members. Aramil the once fallen, Tycerian the stone, Grimwald the Blackstaff and Flint Ironforge the hungry. 

## The Past Is Now

The party thinks that that may have been Ris Nsi. but they think that Isalawa was truthful and forth coming. So, the party knows that Mezro once disappeared. and thinks that Dendar is the one that attacks 400 years ago and then Ris Nsi is going to try and bring Merkal to do the world. 

The party continues after receiving another key that was in the bag that Isalawa gave them. The key was a garnet stone key. There was a person standing looking like Wakanga O'tamu in ethereal form. Wakanga in this form did not recognize them, however, posed a question: does the party seek power or riches? The adventurers chose power, which Wakanga said is to the left. Aramil thinks that Wakanga is telling them the truth. 

The group takes the left that leads them to power, which looks to them like a chest stuffed with gold. The group gets nearer, and suddenly, the chest's gold disappears. They get close enough and prods the chest with a quarterstaff. The chest is eventually opened, and in the chest there is a pair of Gauntlets of Ogre Power. These gauntlets will grant the wearer high strength. The group decides to give the gauntlets to Tycerian.

## Shadow of a Doubt

As the group moves on, they walk into a structure and investigate the glass window. Looking through at first, they see nothing.  Grimwald decides to light up the interior and see nothing more than stone inside. The group walks through the door and suddenly the torches light up. An hour glasses that is held up by two metal rods sits on top of a stone brick pedestal in the middle of the room. Metal plates embedded into the ground exist in the four corners of the room. The group flips the hourglass with mage hand while they all stand on the pads. The plates move the group into the air slowly, then they jump down and investigate. 

They they were standing on the tops of cages, while the door behind them locks shut. The four cages are five feet in diameter, with a shimmering purple aura that surrounds them. Each cage has something inside: the one to the north-east has a statue of a shadow demon. The one to the south-east has a burning candle. The one to south-west has a sword stuck in a block of ice, covering ancient writing. The one to the north-west has a sapling peeking out of soil.

Unable to solve the puzzle the lights go out and a shadow demon runs darts from the statue and goes into the wall. The demon comes up from the ground and attacks Aramil first. Then swipes at Flint, damaging him as the demon did to Aramil. When the demon attacked Flint, Grimwald blasts the shadow demon, instantly killing it with a single hit from Guiding Bolt. Once the demon dies all the cage’s contents disappear, and the east door opens. The adventurer's proceed through the open door.

## A Knight's Tale

The group comes to a jousting area. With a knight on an allosaurus and a lance in hand. There is a scroll on the wall to their left that Grimwald reads.  Rules of the Joust: First to five points wins. One point is awarded for breaking a lance against your enemy. Two points are awarded for unhorsing your enemy. Automatically victory should you knock your enemy unconscious. Flint holds back Grimwald as Tycerian get on the allosaurus. Shortly after Flint feels his armor getting hot as he helps Tycerian prepare for the joust.

Tycerian nocks the knight dead on and unhorses the knight on his first hit. One more pass, and the score remains at 2-0, with the adventurers leading. Vorn calls out to Flint to be the next challenger after a couple passes with Vorn, his turn ending with a score of 3-1, in favor of the party. Aramil's turn comes and goes, putting the tally at 4-2, in favor of the party. Vorn calls out to Grimwald and then Grimwald gets hit with the lance making the score 4-3. Tycerian gets the final hit on the guardian, finishing the joust at 5-3. 

The knight rounds the fences and then disappears, along with both allosaurus. An emerald key appears on the ground, which is picked up. An opening on the opposite side of the jousting field appears, which they continue through. 

## The Floor Is Lava

After walking down the path there is a wide-open room, the bottom of which is full of lava, 100 feet down. The square room has a circular pillar in the center with a chest on the platform. To the right there is a sack of gold coins near their feet. The group attempts to have Aramil run across with the immoveable rod, which gets him there, only to find an empty chest with a note etched into the bottom of the chest: "A reward for your sacrifice". 

The group tosses in the bag of coins to the lava below and a bridge appears. They find three Adamatine ingots with a hammer stamp on them and a set of Mariner's Chain Mail. 

## Final Guardian

The party come across a gold door with three indentations and a catlike figure standing in black robes. As they approach, they see a tiger-man, with a mustache that reminds them of a handlebar, and a monocle on his left eye. He congratulates them on a job well done and a completed journey. 

Uk’tarana is his name. He says the door behind him will lead to freedom. Uk’tarana is a spirit of the maze, and he takes this form from one of the previous people that passed that maze. Uk’tarana completed the maze some few hundred years ago. His hand faces backwards, as if the wrist were twisted. Tycerian became hostile to Uk’tarana, not trusting him. After sensing the distrust, Uk’tarana suggested to Tycerian that he put the key in an indentation behind him. Grimwald cast mage hand to get the gem from Tycerian as he moved forward, but Uk'tarana muttered some words and appeared to stop the spell. Flint mutters the words for zone of truth. When Flint ask what will happen once they open the door, Uk’tarana says that there is a chamber where we will fight a battle, a battle that might shed some light on things to come. The party puts the keys into the door and opens the door to see a glaring light. Uk’tarana mentions that perhaps they will meet again, and vanishes.

## Snakes on a Spiritual Plane

The party feels in limbo as they become enveloped into the light. As they gain consciousness they are in a large room. Standing on a platform with their backs against a wall. The platform is half a circle and surrounded by a body of water. The ceiling is high, just about as wide as the room. There is a bridge to another circular platform. 

The area is well lit by braziers and in the light, we can see serpent people and humans. They appear to be performing a ritual with the limp body of a human. A human stands over the body, seemingly carving it with a knife. There is a figure in robes with a staff floating above them all

The party, still in their ethereal form, witnesses the group of human and snake-people all start chanting in a language we don’t understand. The body is raised to the sky in the clutches of one of the humans as the human begins to turn into a snake, becoming larger and larger. Once his transformation is complete, he swallows the body whole. The hooded figure is pleased with the display.

The hooded figure then mentions the intruders, as particpants of the ritual turn to their attention.
