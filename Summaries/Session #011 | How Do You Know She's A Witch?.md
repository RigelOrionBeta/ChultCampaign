## The Ruins of Mbala
After their encounter with the drakes, the party make their way back down the stairs to find the dinosaurs have given up on them. They make their way up the weaving road to the top of the Mbala mesa. At the top of the mesa they find a ruined village. Throughout the village they find bones - all seem to indicate something, or someone, gnawing on them. They find nothing else of note until they spot further up the village a lone hut, with smoke billowing out. They proceed cautiously. 

## Ancient Memories
Inside the hut, they find an impossibly old human woman - wrinkled and near deaf. She tells the tale of Mbala - a village destroyed one by one by the terror folk, large, reptilian flying beasts, resembling the pteradon, but bigger in size and showing some humanoid characteristics. She also gives the party some information about Ris Nsi, remembering him as a handsome, young ruler, a war hero, of the city Mezro, who lost his title somehow. Seeking revenge, he invaded the city with an undead army, but was defeated. She hadn't heard of him since then. She also reveals herself to be a follower of the god Myrkul, the lord of bones, death and necromancy, and claims to have the ability to resurrect the dead through a ritual. The woman, who calls herself Nany Pu'pu, says she will reveal more information (after being accused of being dishonest by Aramil), if they complete a task for her: kill the terror folk who killed her friends and destroyed the town. They accept the task and set off.

## A Haggardly End
The party manages to kill the terror folk, but not with ease - Grimwald nearly dies twice, and did major damage as the terror folk clumped up, with a follow up attack from Aramil. They defeat the threat but realize Saerumir and Jerdenal are missing after staying back from the mission. They follow the trail of blood and footsteps from where they left them to the hut of Nany Pu'pu. Inside is a green hag, hunched over the open chest of Jerdenal. She clutches a heart, then makes a move toward Saerumir, before her door is burst down by Grimwald and Aramil falls through the roof. Flint ensures Saerumir is alive, while Tycerian tracks down the now invisible hag. A golem of flesh comes out from forest to attack as well. After trading blows, the party manages to kill the hag and the flesh golem but lose Jerdenal. They burn his body with the hut in a ceremony to remember him, with Flint saying a short prayer in Gond's name. They take a rest to continue their journey tomorrow. 

## Wanted
After hiking down the road leading up to Mbala, they are met by a singing tiger-man, who approaches them asking for Aramil Moonwhisper. He gives him a coin, depicting a horned dinosaur on one face, and explains that the Ytepka Society has sent him. Contacting this person telepathically, Aramil gains an understanding that he is wanted by a merchant prince and ordered to return to port. If he refuses to comply, he will be brought to port by other means. The tiger-man seems to be nervous and doesn't part with this information without hesitation, then parts with the group.
