# Welcome to the Jungle

## A Prince's Pride
The adventurers make a stop at the local markets to gather some supplies, on the advice of Saerumir, before heading to the western part of town to meet back up with the elf they rescued. Named Iralda, the female elf explains how she managed to get into her predicament - after an audience with a Merchant Prince to request assistance in find a powerful artifact named the Emberstone, who mocked her and refused her request, she spat on him. The embarrassed merchant had her arrested and ordered her execution. Iralda thanks the party for their role in saving her life and leave the task of finding the artifact to Aramil and his party, before leaving the port to go back to her hometown Faerimir, with a few other elves who came with her. 

## With A Vengeance

Prior to leaving the port, they make a stop at their Temple of Gond and meet Master Hagrud, an albino dwarf. Flint asks for Hector, the man he's tasked to gift the box to, who also worshipped Gond. They are told by Hagrud that he was called upon by the Order of the Forge to go to Camp Vengeance, a base to the southwest that is used as a headquarters for the Order's mining and exploration operations. The party, now with a destination, set out to Camp Vengeance with a guide at their side. After encounters with some of the Chultan wildlife - including four undead tigers and several flying pteradon, they find themselves approaching Camp Vengeance just as night is falling.
