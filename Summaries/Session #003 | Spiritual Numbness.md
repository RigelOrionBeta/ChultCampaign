# Spiritual Numbness

*by Volothamp Geddarm*

*16th of September, the Year 2054*

## Exploring Wavecrest
Tycerian, Flint, Grimwald and Aramil awake the following morning. The boat that made landfall the previous day is considered under investigation and is un-operational, due to the fire on the main mast. They are told the next ship will arrive in a couple days, which has been prioritized for them. Tycerian makes a step at the local weapons store, where he meets Rolof of house Rolof, also called "The Lost", who claims to be centuries old and a descendant of the dynasty that ruled the ancient city Omu. He buys a sword. 

## Seeking Forgiveness
Flint, currently digesting a hand, feels his own hand go numb. Feeling this must be a sign from the gods, Flint heads to the Temple he visited the day prior to pray to his god, Gond, the god of craftsmanship. The numbness goes away, and speaks briefly with Brent of Feltown, an elderly man who wishes to get a gift to his brother, Hector, a priest in the Order of the Forge. Brent says he cannot make the trip himself, due to his increasingly frail body. Flint accepts this mission, and is given a box, and told not to open it. 

## A Bard's Regret
The party spends another night at the Misty Inn, before awakening once more in Wavecrest. They head to the docks to find a ship named Reverend's Regret, helmed by Gwarth Pendleton, a male orc and his orc crew. Gwarth gives a brief explanation of the ship, with its complex ballista meant to make it easier to board ships, and then they set sail. On the second day of sailing, a ship is noticed in the distance. The ship closes distance, faster than the party's ship, moving aggressively. The ships masts depict an eye on fire - the sign of a group of pirates known as the Ravagers. The crew prepares for an attack, as the other ship, named the Wayward Bard, opens with cannon fire. The ballistaâ€™s fire, hitting the ship and slowly reeling it in. The party manages to kill the pirates on board and commandeer the ship. Onboard is a sizeable treasure, which they share among themselves. They sail into the Bay of Chult with two boats.
