# An Ancient Avatar

## Seeking Wisdom
After catching their breath, the party decides to change course - making their way to a temple to the north, where they heard from Commander Ilral an avatar of Ubtao lives. Ubtao, the god of Chult, is known to have created the land and its dinosaurs but abandoned its creation after seeing its inhabitants grew to become greedy. They make it to the temple, but not before one party member contracts a disease, which is quickly ridden of by the restoration spell of Flint. 

## Ziggurat at Orolunga

The temple itself sits on top of a ziggurat that has three distinct layers. It was said by Commander Ilral that the place was mysterious and magical, and it was. Vines that covered the steps to the first layer attacked any who stepped on them. It was only with a small creature's help, the Chwinga, that they were able to make it to the top of the ziggurat. Once at the top, they entered the shrine. 

Inside was a guardian naga named Saja N'baza, an avatar for the god Chult. She gave information about what plagues the land - a necromancer by the name of Ris Nsi, who lives under Omu. Ris Nsi, she says, needs to be dealt with for the damage he has created on Chult, namely the undead that have ravaged the land for the last couple hundred years, and the destruction of a major city, Mezro. She also tells the party that the curse itself seems to originate from below Omu as well but does not understand much else about its nature and source. 

Before leaving, the party accepts gifts - each get a charm of a different power, to aid in their journey. Grimwald is, separately, given a symbol representing the god Ubtao, who would later contact him through Saja N'baza during his rest and task him with ridding the land of a lich named Valindra Shadowmantle, who has made the Heart of Ubtao her home. The party sets off from the ziggurat to complete their new tasks.
