# Old Enemies

*by Volothamp Geddarm*

*8th of October, the Year 2054*

## Blackguard
The party presses on after their encounter with the goblins to the Aldani Basin. After a few days they make it to the foot of Mbala, which they decide to visit. Before they can make it there however, they encounter a small band of people who seem to have among them a captive. Tycerian recognizes them as the Blackguard, a group of treasure hunters who also work as mercenaries. Tycerian tells a tale of his prior dealings with them, who nearly tricked him into stealing from innocent villagers of the town Peldomar. He killed two of their members after he ended his relationship with the Blackguard, who tried to steal from him. The party makes their way to the camp of the Blackguard to parley. One member of the group seems to recognize Tycerian, while Grimwald pretends to be an archeologist looking for mines. After threatening Grimwald to take him as an additional prisoner, he unleashes a fury of magical attacks that cripples the leader, who called himself Jeremus. Seconds later, he is killed, along with the rest of the Blackguard troop, save for an orc who manages to escape. 

## A Lone Survivor
The place is looted, where they find some new magical items, and the prison is freed. He introduces himself as Jerdenal, a cartographer, who works with the Order of the Forge. His group was looking for mining spots to the south when they were attacked by fire newts, and then undead. He believes he is the only survivor. He was captured by the Blackguard group and forced to reveal his knowledge to them. He thanks them for their help in saving him. The party then decides to take a long rest, and focus their effort on climbing Mbala afterwards, with Jerdenal agreeing to come with them before a trip back to Camp Vengeance.
